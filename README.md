## Introduction

The Greenhouse Environment Monitoring and Management System is an integrated setup combining embedded devices, a centralized server, and seamless networking. It provides continuous monitoring of conditions like temperature and humidity, ensuring ideal plant growth. Sensor data can be analyzed via a website or by the system itself, it will push alarms if any anomalies occurs. This cohesive system ensures agricultural efficiency and proactive management of greenhouse environments.

## Architecture

- Service-Oriented Architecture: using source control design:  manyrepo instead of monorepo
  - [Server GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mart337i/fastapi-nginx-gunicorn)
  - [Client GrovePi GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mart337i/embeded_device)

## Server Side


<a name="about-the-server"></a>

#### About the Server

The server is running Raspberry Pi OS Lite which is a lightweight version of the Raspberry Pi operating system, based on Debian Linux.

 It is optimized for the Raspberry Pi hardware and is a command-line only interface, meaning no graphical desktop.


<a name="main-api-and-endpoints"></a>

### Main API and endpoints

The API facilitates greenhouse environment monitoring and management, handling sensor data for temperature and humidity, and allows for configuration changes and retrieval of current settings. It supports the creation of new facility, building, and sensor records, and offers a dashboard view for real-time data and alerts

## Client Side

<a name="linux-based-client"></a>

### Linux Based Client

<a name="about-the-client"></a>

#### About the Client

The client is a raspberry 3 using grovepi sensors

<a name="how-to-use-it-3"></a>

#### How to Use It

Using an ssh client on the client device and use the following `git clone git@github.com:mart337i/embeded_device.git`

Make sure python3 is installed along with everything in the requirements.txt file
The requirements.txt can be installed with `python3 -m pip<version> -r requirements.txt`

and then just setup the [Systemd](#Systemd_config) unit file and run the systemd commands shown below

**systemd commands** 
```bash

systemctl enable <name of service>.service
systemctl start <name of service>.service
systemctl status <name of service>.service
systemctl restart <name of service>.service

```

<a name="tools-and-frameworks-3"></a>

#### Tools and Frameworks

- SystemD

  - systemd is system and service manager for most Unix like operating systems
    As the system boots up, the first process created, i.e. init process with
    PID = 1, is systemd system that initiates the userspace services.

    For this project it is used to start the client service, to collect information from the sensors.
    The main benefit is the automatic start on boot and the auto restart on failiure.
    <br/><br/>

  <a name="Systemd_config"></a>
  - SystemD config

    ```bash
    [Unit]
    Description=embeded service
    After=multi-user.target

    [Service]
    StartLimitBurst=0
    Type=simple
    Restart=on-failure
    StartLimitIntervalSec=10
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/code/embeded_device/main.py

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

- Python libs
  - grovepi
    - open-source platform for connecting Grove Sensors to the Rasberry Pi.
  - datetime
    - Used for constructing datetime objects.
  - requests
    - allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily.
  - python-dotenv
    - Python-dotenv reads key-value pairs from a .env file
  - json
    - built-in package which can be used to work with JSON data.
  - logging
    - provides a flexible framework for writing log messages
  - time
    - provides functions for handling time-related tasks (Only used the sleep method)

### Embedded Device

<a name="about-the-device"></a>

#### About the Device

I am using the M5GO, powered by the ESP32 chip, which is an embedded device designed for IoT applications, capable of collecting data from APIs. It features a dual-core processor, Wi-Fi connectivity, and 16M flash memory.

<a name="how-to-use-it-4"></a>

#### How to Use It

To use the program simply run `git clone git@github.com:mart337i/embeded_device.git` from the device you are deploying with using platformIO. And then simply press the `->` to upload(Also and image below)

[program:fastapi-app]
command=/home/pi/code/fastapi-nginx-gunicorn/gunicorn_start
user=pi
autostart=true
autorestart=true

redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/home/pi/code/dashboard_fastapi-nginx-gunicorn/logs/gunicorn-error.log

```

### Firewall settings
The ports specified below are required open:

- **OpenSSH**: This rule allows remote logins via the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol, which by default uses port 22. This is essential for securely managing the server remotely.
- **22**: This explicitly allows traffic on port 22, which is the default port for SSH connections.
- **80**: This opens up port 80, which is the default port used for HTTP traffic.
- **443**: This port is for HTTPS traffic, which is HTTP over TLS/SSL, providing secure web browsing (i chould close this becouse i dont use https, but i am keeping it open for further development).

The rules are duplicated for IPv6 traffic (indicated by `(v6)`), ensuring the server accepts connections via both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols on these ports.


```bash
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere

80                         ALLOW       Anywhere
443                        ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
22 (v6)                    ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
80 (v6)                    ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
443 (v6)                   ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

### Code of conduct

#### File structure

```bash

/home/pi/code
|   dashboard
|   fastapi (Main api)
|   Nginx_log (Error and access log for both)
|
/etc/nginx
|   nginx.conf (Base config)
|   sites-enabled
|       fastapi-app.conf (Custom config)
|
/etc/supervisor/conf.d
    dashboard.conf (Dashboard config)
    fastapi-app.conf (Fastapi config)

```

#### Git guidelines

Not all of the following has been used but is still consideres part of the Code conduct.

```Text
    [FIX] for bug fixes: mostly used in stable version but also valid if you are fixing a recent bug in development version;

    [REF] for refactoring: when a feature is heavily rewritten;

    [ADD] for adding new modules;

    [REM] for removing resources: removing dead code, removing views, removing modules, â€¦;

    [REV] for reverting commits: if a commit causes issues or is not wanted reverting it is done using this tag;

    [MOV] for moving files: use git move and do not change content of moved file otherwise Git may loose track and history of the file; also used when moving code from one file to another;

    [IMP] for improvements: most of the changes done in development version are incremental improvements not related to another tag;

    [MERGE] for merge commits: used in forward port of bug fixes but also as main commit for feature involving several separated commits;

    [I18N] for changes in translation files;

```

### Still missing overall

- Fail2ban (SSH Brutefore attack protecion)
- JTW or another token based api security
- SSL Cert
- auth0 for dashboard (Maybe over engineering)
- Hide nginx version i network tab
- Block accses to doc files 


<a name="conclusion" ></a>
## Conclusion

This project has personally given me knowlegde about how to set up production ready api's and server set ups. While there is still a lot to be done to make it acceptiable to be used in enterprise level production, i feel many steps ahead of then i first started the project. 

I have also gained knowlegde in the usage of unix based systems and look forward to learn more about the capability
